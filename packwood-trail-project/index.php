 <p>Residents and lovers of Packwood have identified the need for a trail, or a system of trails that (are):</p>
		<ul>
            <li>Multi-use (hiker, biker, runner, hunter friendly), non-motorized</li>
		    <li>Accessible year round (below the winter snowline)</li>
		    <li>Easy to hike/ride (more/less flat)</li>
		    <li>Pavement Accessible (can drive on a paved road to trail head)</li>
		    <li>Provide an economic benefit to the Packwood community</li>
		    <li>Bring together federal, state, and local agencies with interested organizations and Packwood community</li>
            <li>Interpret rich cultural history of Packwood (pre-Columbian to present)</li>
            <li>Use and/or link in to historic and currently maintained trails</li>
        </ul>
		
        <h2>Need</h2>

		<p>The needs for such a trail or network of trails can be categorized in several ways:</p>
		<ul>
          <li>Filling a void in recreational opportunities</li>
		  <li>Economic growth</li>
		  <li>Building a stronger community</li>
		  <li>Health and fitness / quality of life</li>
          <li>Relationships between government agencies, the community, and public organizations</li>
        </ul>
    

		<p>There are more than 30 trails that are within 10 air miles of Packwood.  However, these trails are neither accessible during the winter nor for much of the shoulder seasons.  From November until April, there is a noticeable absence of outdoor experiences, trail running, hiking, and bike riding.  This is neither by design nor by necessity.  Although downtown Packwood (elevation 1060 feet) does often get snow during the winter months, it rarely stays around for more than a week.  The winter snowline usually starts at about 2000 feet.</p>


		<p>Furthermore, trails that do exist near Packwood are too steep to ride up or for many, even to walk up.  Most of the trails leave from the valley floor and climb several thousand feet within one or two miles.</p>
     
        <p>In the table below a 'red x' means that the local trail does NOT meet our goals.  A 'green check' means that it does.  You can see that there are no trails in our local area that meet our community's year around needs for recreational trails.</p>

 <h3>Where is Packwood?</h3>
    
 <p>Packwood is located 90 miles west of Yakima and 75 miles east of Centralia on Highway 12 just south of Mt. Rainier. Packwood is one of the more remote small cities in Western Washington.  Until the mid-2000's, Packwood was driven by a forest products economy with a lumber mill and a Forest Service work center.  These two employers, plus a strong seasonally recreational community, provided the economic base for the town.  Since the mill closed and the Forest Service closed the work center, the town of Packwood has struggled to find a new identity and promote and rely on its deeply rich recreational opportunities.</p>
